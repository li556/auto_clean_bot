# Introduction
CLient_SDK project is the software development tool to help application developers easily interact with lidar(robinw). This tool supports multiple development languages, such as C++, C, python, R and so forth. And Rich development documentation([HOW_TO_USE_CLIENT_SDK.md](./docs/HOW_TO_USE_CLIENT_SDK.md)) and sample code([simple_get_pcd.cpp](./apps/example/simple_get_pcd.cpp)) are provided to allow developers to get quickly started. Besides, there are some useful execution files and scripts in ```apps``` directory. For detailed information, please refer to the corresponding documents in each directory.
